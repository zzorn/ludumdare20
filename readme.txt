Ludum dare #20 entry by zzorn

Controls: 
WASD for move
Space for jump.
F1 opens game editor.

Your objective in each level is to reach the goal platform, whereafter you get teleported to the next level.

Gameplay is pretty non-existent, and only the first level is tuned, but submitting anyway.

Requires Sun Java VM v 1.6
